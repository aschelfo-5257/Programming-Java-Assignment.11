## Pattern Matching:
In Java, the method of Pattern Matching refers to the language constructs and syntax that enable you to check an objectâ€™s type (or structure) and, if it matches, extract the relevant data directly within the same expression or block. Pattern matching is not a single method or function, but a feature embedded in the syntax of certain constructs, primarily:

    static String formatter(Object obj) {
      return switch (obj) {
          case Integer i -> String.format("int %d", i);
          case Long l    -> String.format("long %d", l);
          case String s  -> String.format("String %s", s);
          default        -> obj.toString();
      };
    }

In essence, Pattern matching is an evolving feature in Java, available for the instanceof operator, switch statements, and (in preview) with records and arrays. It makes code more concise and type-safe when working with different types or object structures.
